# Rackspace Containers
### dorap - The Docker-Rackspace Plugin

This directory currently contains only a simple Docker file that may be
used to create a simple Ubuntu image with [Pyrox](http://github.com/zinic/pyrox)
installed. Further steps will begin from here to extend the image with
a default configuration and more.
